Reality
At present, users have encountered many problems when using existing chat platforms, which affect their communication efficiency and experience. The main problems include but are not limited to the following:
• User interface complexity: Existing user interfaces are not intuitive enough for new users, resulting in high learning costs. In addition, some advanced features are hidden deeper and not easy to be found.
• Security Concerns: While we have certain security measures in place to protect the privacy of our users, some users have expressed concerns about the security of their data, especially when it comes to the transfer of sensitive information.
• Emoji Compatibility: While our app supports basic emoji features, display errors often occur when users try to use newer or more complex emoji. This limits how users can express themselves and can lead to misunderstandings.
These problems reflect the shortcomings of the current application in terms of user experience and technical implementation, and there is an urgent need to improve the overall service quality through improvement.

This project should be regarded as critical software, which means a failure can disrupt business processes and operations, causing inefficiencies or halting operations altogether, affecting the timelines for other projects. The failed project can not only escalate and become a runaway system but can also go to market with fundamental flaws that could bring harm to the privacy of users. The chat application will continue to fall short of user expectations, leading to lower user engagement. Faster competitors may offer more advanced features such as emoji support with AI. Resources spent on the failed project will be wasted, resulting in inefficient allocation of time, financial resources, and manpower. The business may also incur higher customer support and maintenance costs. Additionally, project delays may cause revenue loss due to late market entry. 
Effective project planning can help mitigate these consequences, but failure can still have a lasting impact on multiple aspects.
